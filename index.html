            <p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal,
                or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or
                minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
                energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding
                behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific
                ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.

                Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. The
                majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food
                with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution
                systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the
                food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much
                as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions</p>
